# Flutter Firebase Authentication Example

This is a simple Flutter app with three pages - a login page, a home page, and a registration page. The app uses Firebase Authentication and the `google_sign_in` package to allow users to log in/register with Google, email address and password, and view the home page.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Flutter on your machine
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies
5. Run the app using `flutter run`

This will launch the app in your default emulator or on your connected device.

## About the app

The app consists of three pages:

- `LoginPage`: This page allows users to log in using their email address and password, or with their Google account. The app uses Firebase Authentication and the `google_sign_in` package to handle the login process.
- `RegisterPage`: This page allows users to register for the app using their email address and password. The app uses Firebase Authentication to handle the registration process.
- `HomePage`: This page displays a welcome message to the user after they have logged in successfully.

## Conclusion

Building a simple Flutter app with Firebase Authentication and Google Sign-In is a great way to learn how to integrate Firebase and Google services into your apps. By following the steps outlined in the README, you can easily set up Firebase Authentication and Google Sign-In in your app and create a login page, registration page, and home page. This project can serve as a foundation for more complex apps that use Firebase for data storage and other features. With Flutter, Firebase, and Google services, you can quickly develop high-quality mobile apps that are scalable and easy to maintain.
